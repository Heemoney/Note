# Introduction

## Welcome to the C# Utilities repo!!!

>First off, thank you for considering contributing to the C# Utility class library. We're a work in progress but it's people like you that make this repo such a great tool.

## Why read this?

>Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Contributions we look for

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

> C# Utilities is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into C# Utilities itself.

> Responsibilities
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Ensure that code that goes into the repo meats the checklist provided on the pull request template
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. Read the Code of Conduct!

# Ground Rules

## Behaviorial Expectations (from us and you)
Read the code of conduct: [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/manu-p-1/CSharp-Utilities/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Getting started

### How to Contribute 101
1. Start off by downloading a test editor or IDE. Visual Studio is ideal, but JetBrains Rider or Atom are great choices as well.
Some IDE's come with built in Github integration making your life easier.

2. Download Git (if your not using a text editor with Git integration)

3. Simply fork the repository to make your additions or changes. How? [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

### Your First Contribution
For your first contribution, get a feel of how the project works, try running it and perusing through the code.

> As a rule of thumb, changes that are obvious fixes, which do not introduce any new functionality, creative thinking, or change functionality, will be merged almost immediately. Such changes pursuant to the following:
>* Spelling / grammar fixes
>* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
>* Comment clean up
>* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
>* Adding logging messages or debugging output
>* Changes to ‘metadata’ files .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
>* Moving source files from one directory to another

> Changes which do change functionality or creative thinking will require a full explanation on the pull request template as well as an analysis from our team before being merged.

4. After making changes, submit a pull request. Remember to read and fill out the PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE.
Read the following to understand how to create a pull request:
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/
REMEMBER TO READ THE PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE. Answer all questions that the template asks. Failure to do so will result in a immediate closed pull request.

> Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
> If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

### How to file a bug report

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
> 1. What version of C# are you using?
> 3. What did you do?
> 4. What did you expect to see?
> 5. What did you see instead?

# Suggesting a feature
> If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in the C# Utilities library, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that Elasticsearch has today have been added because our users saw the need. Simply open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

> The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. The pull request may be closed due to inactivity. If we believe that the request enhances any part of the C# Utilities repo,
you should expect the pull request to be merged within a week.
